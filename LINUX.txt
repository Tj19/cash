2. Create a directory “exercises” inside your home directory. cd to this new directory.


           	tj@tj-HP-15-Notebook-PC:~$ mkdir exercises
		tj@tj-HP-15-Notebook-PC:~$ cd exercises
		tj@tj-HP-15-Notebook-PC:~/exercises$ 

3. Create 3 empty files , file1.txt,file2.txt,file3.txt in current directory (exercises).

		tj@tj-HP-15-Notebook-PC:~/exercises$ cp file1.txt ~/exercises/files


5. Copy the entire exercise directory to this files directory.

6. Create a symlink “testlink” in your home directory that points to this file1.txt i.e. ~/exercises/files/file1.txt.

7. Try creating a hard link in your home directory that points to “files” directory .

                                 // hard link not allowed for directory.softlink can be made.


8. Difference between soft and hard link.


A symlink is actually pointing to another path (a file name) and it resolves the name of the file each time you access it through the symlink. If you move the file, the symlink will not follow. If you replace the file with another one, keeping the name, the symlink will point to the new file. Symlinks can span filesystems.
Softlinks are like shortcuts in windows. They do not contain any information about the destination file, the inode of softlink points to the inode of the file.

On the other hand, a hardlink isn't a pointer to a file, it's a directory entry (a file) pointing to the same inode. Even if you change the name of the other file, a hardlink still points to the file. If you replace the other file with a new version (by copying it), a hardlink will not point to the new file. You can only have hardlinks within the same filesystem. 
Hardlinks directly point to the inode of the file on the disk.Any changes done to the hardlink are reflected in the original file as well.



9. Change permissions for files directory such that nobody other than the user who created the directory, can write/update anything in that directory.
